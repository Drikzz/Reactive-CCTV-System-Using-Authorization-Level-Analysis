## üé® GENERAL PROMPT TIPS

### Quality Enhancers to Add:
- `photorealistic`
- `high detail`
- `realistic lighting`
- `security camera footage style`
- `CCTV perspective`
- `surveillance camera angle`
- `8k resolution`
- `professional photography`

### Style Modifiers:
- `realistic office environment`
- `corporate setting`
- `modern office design`
- `professional workplace`
- `indoor lighting`

### Things to AVOID in Prompts:
- ‚ùå Artistic styles (watercolor, cartoon, anime)
- ‚ùå Unrealistic poses or physics
- ‚ùå Multiple people (keep it to one person per image)
- ‚ùå Overly dramatic lighting (unless specified)
- ‚ùå Fantasy or sci-fi elements

---

## üìã GENERATION CHECKLIST

### For Each Image:
- [ ] Matches one of the 30 specified categories
- [ ] Shows clear, realistic human behavior
- [ ] Has security camera perspective
- [ ] Includes environmental context (office/workspace)
- [ ] Has realistic lighting conditions
- [ ] Person is clearly visible and identifiable
- [ ] Activity (using computer OR opening cabinet) is obvious
- [ ] Image quality is high (no blurriness or artifacts)

### After Generation:
- [ ] Review all 60 images (30 per class)
- [ ] Remove any unrealistic or poor quality images
- [ ] Ensure diversity across angles, lighting, and scenarios
- [ ] Resize images to 224x224 for training
- [ ] Add to `datasets/train/using-computer/` or `datasets/train/opening-cabinet/`
- [ ] Retrain model with new diverse dataset

---

## üîß POST-GENERATION PROCESSING

After generating images with AI, process them:

```bash
# Resize all images to 224x224
python behavior_recognition/resize_images.py --input generated_images/ --output datasets/train/

# Verify diversity improved
python behavior_recognition/analyze_dataset_diversity.py --data datasets/train

# Retrain with new data
python behavior_recognition/train_focused_augmentation.py --data datasets --epochs 30 --batch-size 16
```

Expected diversity score improvement:
- Before: 2.3-2.6 (VERY LOW)
- After: 15-25 (MEDIUM to GOOD) ‚úÖ

---

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS

After adding these 60 diverse synthetic images:

**Test Accuracy:**
- Current: 95% overall, 90% using-computer
- Expected: **97-98% overall, 95%+ using-computer** ‚úÖ

**Confidence on Unseen Angles:**
- Current: 56-65% on unusual perspectives
- Expected: **75-85% on unusual perspectives** ‚úÖ

**Coverage:**
- Current: Only 1-2 dominant camera angles
- Expected: **6+ different angles/perspectives** ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ PRIORITY ORDER

If generating all 60 is too much, prioritize in this order:

### High Priority (Must Have):
1. Using-computer: Front view (10 images) - Fixes laptop-back recognition issue
2. Using-computer: Top-down (5 images) - Fixes overhead angle problem
3. Opening-cabinet: Different types (10 images) - Reduces cabinet overfitting

### Medium Priority (Should Have):
4. Using-computer: Far-away (5 images) - Helps with scale invariance
5. Opening-cabinet: Different angles (10 images) - Improves angle robustness

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have):
6. Using-computer: Side view (5 images)
7. Using-computer: Different lighting (5 images)
8. Opening-cabinet: Different distances (10 images)

**Minimum viable improvement: Generate at least 30 total images (items 1, 2, 3)**

---

## üìù NOTES

- Save generated images with descriptive names: `using_computer_front_01.jpg`
- Keep originals in case you need to regenerate
- Test model after each batch of 10 images to track improvement
- Document which prompts worked best for future reference
- Consider using multiple AI tools for maximum diversity

**Good luck! üöÄ**
