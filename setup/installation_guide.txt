âœ… Installation Guide for Thesis System

This guide helps you set up your environment to run the YOLOv8 and Face Recognition modules.

1. ðŸ“¦ Basic Dependencies

Run this command to install the base libraries:
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
```

2. ðŸ”¥ Install PyTorch (Required for YOLOv8)

YOLOv8 depends on PyTorch. For CPU-only systems, install it using:

For GPU-enabled systems (change cu118 based on your CUDA version):
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```bash

(Official instructions: https://pytorch.org/)

3. ðŸ§  Install FaceNet and Other Core Dependencies

For FaceNet and other core libraries, run the following:
```
pip install keras-facenet numpy opencv-python tensorflow keras scikit-learn matplotlib
```bash

4. ðŸ“¦ Optional for Saving/Loading Models

If you need to save/load models (e.g., for FaceNet), you can install joblib:
```
pip install joblib
```bash

5. âœ… Test Your Setup

Run this to test your YOLOv8 setup:
```
python yolov8_setup.py
```bash

ignore ignore ignore

If everything works, it will load yolov8n.pt and perform inference on sample_image.jpg.

Make sure you're in the root folder of the project (thesis_system/), then run:
```
pip install setup/dlibâ€‘19.24.0â€‘cp38â€‘cp38â€‘win_amd64.whl
```bash

Replace the filename if you're using another version of Python or OS.

Then install:
```
pip install face_recognition
```bash
